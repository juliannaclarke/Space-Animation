# Space-Animation
A fun project built with OpenFrameworks to animate planetary orbits, and uses linear interpolation to fly a spaceship around the window.

This project requires OpenFrameworks to run. I have uploaded the source code and for now this will remain a source code only version of the app. I intend to make it playable in the near future.
